# PV207 - team project

## About

The team project was developed for the course [PV207](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2020/PV207?lang=en) in the spring 2020 semester. Within the project, the task of a team of four people was to invent a company for which it was necessary to perform domain analysis, analysis and process design. And on the basis of these analyzes and design implement processes, services and test the solution. Used tools: [jBPM](https://www.jbpm.org/), [Signavio](https://www.signavio.com/). Work on the project was documented in the documentation.
